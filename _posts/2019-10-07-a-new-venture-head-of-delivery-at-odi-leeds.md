I have recently agreed to take on the role of Head of Delivery at ODI Leeds, building on my long-term relationship with the team. I’m very excited, not least as it gives me as an opportunity to work more closely with some of the most passionate people I know, and help them spend more time doing great stuff.

One of my first tasks will be understanding the current committed work and future pipeline. Once this is done, I have some radical ideas about bringing large project software engineering approaches to the relatively smaller scale projects that ODI Leeds gets involved with. I shall be blogging about this in the open, in line with ODI Leeds’ Radically Open ethos.
