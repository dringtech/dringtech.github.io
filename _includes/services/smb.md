IT HEALTH CHECK

Give your business a clear IT roadmap to make the best of your investment.
Recent developments in IT such as Cloud software and infrastructure mean that your business could reduce overheads and become more responsive to change, whilst increasing the quality of service you experience. A simple IT Health Check report can help you decide where to focus your IT spend.

I will ask about your key business processes, software and hardware during our first meeting. This will help me build up a picture of your business and identify a few areas of possible focus. I'll summarise our discussion in an IT Health Check document which you are free to take away, read and ponder.

If you decide that you'd like me to develop your strategy further, we'll meet, prioritise areas of focus and agree a plan to deliver a strategy which will identify a roughly costed programme of work with associated savings.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

Enterprise-proven implementation expertise

If you already have a project in mind I can help you realise it in a cost effective and strategic manner. I have experience of a wide range of technologies and project approaches: contact me to discuss your requirements.

I have successfully helped small local businesses complete the following projects

Website redesign and relaunch

A pre-school nursery wanted to make more use of their website to engage with current and prospective parents. I advised them on product selection, assisted with design and technical implementation and supported staff training.
A physiotherapist had selected a cloud web hosting provider but was struggling to visualise the design and structure of their site. I helped by providing an initial information architecture (pages and menus) and customising a template. This enabled my client to crystallise their ideas and create targeted content. I then restructured the site with the new content and provided technical support in making the site live.

Back office cost optimisation

A non-profit had changed communications provider but risked losing their email provision which was previously bundled with their broadband. I provided support and guidance in retaining this service, and outlined options for moving provision in the future. -->
