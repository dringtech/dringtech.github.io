I have 20 years' experience in project delivery and business system support
for some of the largest retailers, financial services companies and government
customers in the UK.

I can help you to:

* Assess your current IT
* Plan upgrades to software and hardware
* Protect your business from unnecessary risks such as data loss
* Prepare for business expansion by advising on appropriate use of technology
* Implement small, manageable projects to progress my recommendations

<!-- After our first meeting I will prepare a brief report documenting your current
systems, business aspirations and a series of findings and recommendations.

I also offer on-call support for system problems to keep your business up and
running. -->
